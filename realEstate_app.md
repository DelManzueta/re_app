#### Objective:

To develop a comprehensive property management application for a real estate
investor. The app aims to:

-   **Streamline property management operations**:

    -   Automate routine tasks such as rent collection, lease renewals, and
        tenant onboarding.
    -   Provide a centralized dashboard for easy access to all property-related
        information.
    -   Integrate with calendar and scheduling tools to manage inspections,
        viewings, and maintenance tasks.

-   **Improve tenant communications**:

    -   Enable real-time messaging between tenants and property managers via
        in-app chat.
    -   Automate notifications for lease expirations, rent due dates, and
        maintenance schedules.
    -   Create a tenant portal where tenants can submit requests, access their
        lease agreements, and view payment history.

-   **Track financial performance**:

    -   Integrate with QuickBooks for seamless financial management and
        reporting.
    -   Generate comprehensive financial reports including rent roll, expense
        tracking, and profit and loss statements.
